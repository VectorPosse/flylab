recombination frequency of 1% = 1 centimorgan (cM)
2n = 4  which means two sets of chromosomes with 2 chromosomes in each set
the fly is called drosophila
fourth chromosome is often ignored because it is tiny but there are genes we need on it
male/female is not determine by XX and XY, calculate X chromosome to number of autosomes. 1:1 means female, 1:2 means male.
1/2(1-e^(-2m))  m=1 morgan (centimorgan/100)

do:
random number [0,1]
get RF
if greater than that do x, if not do y

mate with chromosomes not traits?

find info for other traits


DO:::

epistasis:
incomplete wing vein and vestigial

9 wild type
4 vestigial
3 incomplete wing vein



make offspring choosable by phenotype

do male/female button
